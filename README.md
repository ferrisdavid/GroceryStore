Summary
---------------------
This project was created by David Ferris, Muhammad Alvi, and Ayaz Nakhuda, out of an interest in creating a project that could help people during the stressful times of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19 the simple task of shopping for daily necessities has become a stressful nightmare for millions around the world, The Grocery Store aims to
bring some of the relaxation and comfort back to this process which has been lost. The Grocery Store is an ecommerce site where users can shop their daily necessities, it
implements all the common functionalities of an ecommerce site such as a shopping cart, checkout, and order history, and extends the functionality to become an expansive consumer
tool with functions such as a store locator for grocery stores of the users choice, nutritional facts for common food items, as well as a built in grocery list builder to help
consumers prepare for their needs. Through this project I have been able to develop skills in both front end and back end web development, including languages and frameworks
such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP as well as experience working with a MySQL database in order to store, retrieve, and manipulate user data.

What is The Grocery Store?
---------------------------
At its core, The Grocery Store is an ecommerce site that allows users to shop for their groceries and various other day to day necessities from the safety of their home during
these difficult and unexpected times, but, in reality, The Grocery Store is much more than this. The Grocery Store is the consumer's ultimate grocery shopping tool that provides
users with various tools to shop, manage, and plan all their grocery needs in one spot, bringing consumers comfort throughout the shopping process during this stressful time.

Goals of The Grocery Store
----------------------------
The goal and inspiration of this project stem from the recent COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of people's abilities to shop for groceries has been limited due to the safety concerns.
The goal of our website is to keep customers safe while they shop for groceries. To achieve this, we made a website that allows users to view, plan, and purchase groceries from
an online platform. To address health concerns, users can look up nutritional facts, as they would read the label in stores. The users can find nearby grocery stores and plan a
trip ahead of time. We followed a 5-week timeline to complete the project with weekly check-ins. Each member of the group was assigned an equal amount of work.
